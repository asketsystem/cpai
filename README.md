# 🧠 Contextually Personal AI
### *Human-Centered Intelligence for Africa's Future*

> **"Know my world before you guide me. Know me before you teach me."**

A revolutionary AI system that combines contextual awareness with personal understanding to create truly human-centered experiences—across **education**, **healthcare**, **agriculture**, **finance**, and **governance**.

---

## 🌍 Why It Matters

Africa is not one thing. It's many places, voices, cultures, and systems. Contextually Personal AI acknowledges this diversity and adapts to:

- Where people live (rural village, city, refugee camp)
- What resources they have (smartphone, chalkboard, no internet)
- What challenges they face (economic, political, educational, environmental)
- Who they are as individuals (language, style, goals, mood)

This is not "AI for Africa."
This is **AI with Africans, for Africans**, by deeply understanding context and the person.

## 🧠 Contextual AI

AI that understands the **situation**:

- Your device and connectivity
- Your region and time zone
- Your current task or challenge
- Your language, calendar, and cultural rhythm

Whether you're a:
- student in Ghana with no internet during exams,
- farmer in Mali deciding on maize or millet,
- nurse in rural Kenya looking up a health protocol,
- market vendor in Côte d'Ivoire managing daily sales,
- or young activist in Abuja trying to access government policy info…

Contextual AI **responds to your world in real time**.

---

## 👤 Personal AI

AI that understands **you**:

- Your learning pace, health concerns, planting season, or income habits
- Your language preferences, energy level, or accessibility needs
- Your progress over time—not just test scores or transactions

Personal AI adapts to:
- **students** who need audio revision instead of text
- **patients** who prefer short summaries in their local language
- **farmers** who want advice based on soil and season
- **entrepreneurs** who need budgeting support
- **citizens** who want to engage with government services intuitively

## React Client Application

A modern React client application is available in the `client/` directory for testing and demonstrating the Advanced Adaptation Models.

### Features
- **Interactive UI** for testing all Phase 4 endpoints
- **Type-safe API integration** with the backend
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- **Real-time feedback** with loading states and error handling

### Quick Start

1. **Start the backend server** (from project root):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the React client** (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and visit `http://localhost:5173`

### Client Features

The React client provides three main interfaces:

1. **Offline Content Generation** - Test content optimization for offline learning
2. **Low Bandwidth Compression** - Test content compression for slow connections  
3. **Behavioral Adaptation** - Test personalized content adaptation

For detailed client documentation, see [client/README.md](client/README.md).
